## Requirements

Depending on your hardware you need different dependencies

### NVIDIA

- nvml

## Install

### Windows

Install LibreHardwareMonitor to access the CPU registry

```
Create:

`sc create rapl type= kernel binPath= "<path_to_LibreHardwareMonitor.sys>"`

Start:

`sc start rapl`

Stop:

`sc stop rapl`

Delete:

`sc delete rapl`

cargo build;
```

### Linux

```
sudo chgrp -R msr /dev/cpu/*/msr;
sudo chmod g+r /dev/cpu/*/msr;
cargo build;
sudo setcap cap_sys_rawio=ep target/debug/energy_bridge; # Any non-root program accessing the msr also needs the rawio capability
```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```
Usage: energi_bridge[.exe] [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...

Arguments:
  [COMMAND]...

Options:
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>

  -s, --separator <SEPARATOR>
          [default: ,]
  -c, --command-output <COMMAND_OUTPUT>

  -i, --interval <INTERVAL>
          Duration of the interval between two measurements in micoseconds [default: 100]
  -g, --gpu

  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print versio
```
